### Running the UI

In order for the UI to work, you will need to copy 'example_keys.json' into 'keys.json' and fill in the appropriate values.

You will also need the package 'mysql-connector-python' installed.

Before the application is run, you will need to run the following files into a MySQL terminal:

- create.sql
- insert.sql
- queries.sql

They must be run in that order. Once the database is seeded, the application can be run and you will see a 'login' asking for an ID number. For testing purposes, you can use the ID number '1' to log in. From there, you can navigate the UI by following the prompts.

**NOTE** The UI is not fully functional. There will be some values and inputs that break the program.
